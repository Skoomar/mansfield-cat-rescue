# To Do

- Adoption page

    - cache bearer token for ~86400 seconds so i don't need to call Redis everytime
    - Loading spinner while request is being carried out? would i even need one if the page is generated server side?
        - loading per item instead of waiting for whole page? would that need paginated request?
    - Make error message on UI if data can't load

- side-note: switch from using npm to pnpm

- send this site to Pawlytics once it's done to show how I used the API

- Use GraphQL client for the API calls
- set up stubs for API calls
- Integration tests & Dockerisation?

# Done

- Set up request to Pawlytics API to get all adoptable cats _in a way that keeps the API call details server-side
- to do this here are the steps:
- need to get a bearer token to use the GraphQL API, so get the token and store it in Upstash Redis KV
  (Key-Vault) through Vercel
- probably should cache this (look at Nextjs docs for fetching & caching data from DB)
- set bearer token in the DB if it's null or expired
- get bearer token when needed for GraphQL request


# Notes
## 2025-03-29
Reading more in-depth about what Apollo Client offers specifically. I think it's way overkill for this use case. I
thought I might need it for state management on the adoption/<cat-id> pages but I don't think it's necessary. This data
would all be loaded server-side to be ready when the page loads - no client interaction that would need to make another
query to the API. So I should just use `fetch` to query the data and then display it instead of using Apollo. Time
to strip it out :facepalm:. At least all the GraphQL plugins and stuff I installed as part of this are useful though

## 2025-03-27
Ok I managed to set up WebStorm and the generated GQL types etc so that's all looking good now. Next need to figure out
how I should actually set up the query - keep it in callPawlytics or move it into Listings.tsx and have a useQuery there,
or do it in a server side component and pass the state down?

## 2025-03-26
Trying to integrate Apollo Client into this using the plugin to make it compatible with Next.js /app router. Have set
up gql with the TypeScript codegen stuff but in the query in Listings.tsx it's still complaining that the attributes
don't exist for some reason.

Also wondering where it's best to put this query - should this be in the page.tsx and then passed down as props to
<Listings />?
