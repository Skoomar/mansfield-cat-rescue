# To Do
- Adoption page
    - Set up request to Pawlytics API to get all adoptable cats *in a way that keeps the API call details server-side*
        - to do this here are the steps:
            - need to get a bearer token to use the GraphQL API, so get the token and store it in Upstash Redis KV
          (Key-Vault) through Vercel
                - probably should cache this (look at Nextjs docs for fetching & caching data from DB)
            - set bearer token in the DB if it's null or expired
            - get bearer token when needed for GraphQL request
    - Loading spinner while request is being carried out
        - loading per item instead of waiting for whole page? would that need paginated request?
    - Error message if data can't load

- side-note: switch from using npm to pnpm

- send this site to Pawlytics once it's done to show how I used the API
