# To Do
- Adoption page
    - Set up request to Pawlytics API to get all adoptable cats *in a way that keeps the API call details server-side*
    - Loading spinner while request is being carried out
        - loading per item instead of waiting for whole page? would that need paginated request?
    - Error message if data can't load

- side-note: switch from using npm to pnpm
