# To Do
- enable upload of images in correct format/size
  - is it worth setting up bi-directional relationship between photo and cat? probably not as you could presumably
  use the same photo for cats in an adoption group
- set up bi-directionality of relationship between cats and adoption groups
  - look at [Join Field](https://payloadcms.com/docs/fields/join) to see if you can show the realtions in the admin
  panel
  - do I use the `defaultPopulate` property for this as well?

- Probably should put the rest of the website in this repo. Combine them and put them as different routes rather
than having them separate. Can you use database in Supabase while hosting the rest of the site separately? Don't see
why you wouldn't be able to
