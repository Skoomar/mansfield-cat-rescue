# To Do

- Adoption page

    - cache bearer token for ~86400 seconds so i don't need to call Redis everytime
    - Loading spinner while request is being carried out? would i even need one if the page is generated server side?
        - loading per item instead of waiting for whole page? would that need paginated request?
    - Make error message on UI if data can't load

- side-note: switch from using npm to pnpm

- send this site to Pawlytics once it's done to show how I used the API

- Use GraphQL client for the API calls
- set up stubs for API calls
- Integration tests & Dockerisation?

# Done

- Set up request to Pawlytics API to get all adoptable cats _in a way that keeps the API call details server-side_
- to do this here are the steps:
- need to get a bearer token to use the GraphQL API, so get the token and store it in Upstash Redis KV
  (Key-Vault) through Vercel
- probably should cache this (look at Nextjs docs for fetching & caching data from DB)
- set bearer token in the DB if it's null or expired
- get bearer token when needed for GraphQL request
