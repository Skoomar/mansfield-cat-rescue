                <p>
                    Mansfield Cat Rescue rescues, rehabilitates and rehomes stray, abandoned, and feral cats. All of our
                    cats and kittens are fostered and looked after in a home environment by our volunteers.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    We have accounts with a number of vet practices that provide veterinary care to our cats and kittens
                    including; spay/neuter, flea and worm medicines, and treatment for abscesses and other large wounds
                    as needed. Our vets also carry out more complicated procedures such as dental work, and damaged eye
                    or ear removal as recommended. Any cats or kittens that are not suitable for adoption due to ongoing
                    health issues, will be looked after by special long-term foster carers.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    All those involved in Mansfield Cat Rescueâ€™s mission do so on a volunteer basis with no
                    renumeration. Our vet bills are paid for by donations and fundraising activities.{' '}
